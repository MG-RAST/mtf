After heating to 98\u00b0C for 5 min, the reaction was cycled as follows: 30-40 cycles of 30s at 96\u00b0C, 30s at 55\u00b0C, and 4 min at 60\u00b0C (9700 thermal cycler AB). Removal of excess of Big Dye Terminators was performed by ethanol precipitation. The samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 10 &#956;l of formamide, loaded onto an Applied Biosystems 3730 sequencer and run for 2 hours. For sequencing, primers B1055 (for bacterial clones) and Arc915 (for archaeal clones) were used.",

Then it was left still at room temperature for two hours in order to recover the green alga Dunaliella salina, very abundant in the environment at the time of the sampling, from the surface of the bottle by aspiration. The sample was then filtered sequentially through 2 &#956;m (Isopore, Millipore) and 0.2 &#956;m pore size filters Durapore, Millipore). Filters were stored at -80\u00b0C until DNA extraction. Thawed filters were cut with a sterile razor blade in small pieces and vortexed in 2 ml of sterile water in 15 ml conical base polypropylene centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 0.1 vol of 10% sodium dodecil sulphate and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) were added. The tubes were incubated at 55\u00b0C for 2 h and in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The lysates were extracted twice with phenol-clhoroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The purified nucleic acids were concentrated by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in sterile Milli-Q water and stored at -20\u00b0C",
