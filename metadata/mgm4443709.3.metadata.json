Briefly, water samples from the coastal mesocosm were collected and processed as follows: 15 l of water from four samples was filtered through a 1.6 &#956;m GF/A filter (Whatman) to remove most phytoplankton cells and this filtrate was collected on 0.22 &#956;m Sterivex filters (Millipore) which were pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until nucleic acid extraction.",
