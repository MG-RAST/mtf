    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%). Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;\u00b0C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 \u00d7 g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml. The virus concentrate was loaded onto a cesium chloride density gradient, centrifuged, and the 1.5&#8201;g&#8201;ml&#8722;1 fraction was collected.",
