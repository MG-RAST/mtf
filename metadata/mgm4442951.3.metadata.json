The animals were kept in sea water during transfer back to the laboratory and were dissected within 24 hours. Four tissues (mantle, digestive gland, gill and foot (Fig. 1)) were dissected from 30 individual animals and flash frozen in tubes placed in dry ice and then stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until used.",
