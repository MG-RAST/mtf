From this sample, two 20-ml subsamples were collected in acid-washed polyethylene bottles and frozen (&#8722;20 \u00b0C) for nutrient and particle analysis. At each station the biological material was size fractionated into individual samples by serial filtration through 20-&#956;m, 3-&#956;m, 0.8-&#956;m, and 0.1-&#956;m filters that were then sealed and stored at &#8722;20 \u00b0C until transport back to the laboratory.",
