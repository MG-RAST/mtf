We used the forward primer 5???- GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3???: the italicized sequence is 454 Life Sciences??? primer B, and the bold sequence is the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F.

NNNNNNNNNNNN designates the unique twelve- base barcode used to tag each PCR product, with ???CA??? inserted as a linker between the barcode and rRNA primer. PCR reactions consisted of HotMaster PCR mix (Eppendorf), 200 _M of each primer, 10-100 ng template, and reaction conditions were 2 min at 95???C, followed by 30 cycles of 20s at 95???C, 20s at 52???C and 60s at 65???C on an Eppendorf thermocycler. Three independent PCRs were performed for each sample, combined and purified with Ampure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt), and products visualized by gel electrophoresis. No-template extraction controls were analyzed for lack of visible PCR products. Products were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay as described above. A master DNA pool was generated from the purified products in equimolar ratios to a final concentration of 21.5 ng mL-1 The pooled products were sequenced using a Roche 454 FLX pyrosequencer at the EnGenCore genome sequencer center at the University of South Carolina.",
