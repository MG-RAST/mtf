A subsample of 2&#8201;l of unfiltered water was collected to measure in situ concentrations of Chla and total DMSP. To exclude eukaryotes and large particles, the remaining seawater was prefiltered by gravity through 3&#8201;&#956;m pore-size polycarbonate filters (142&#8201;mm, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using an inlet filtration system attached directly to the Niskin bottle. Water was dispensed into 20&#8201;l polycarbonate carboys and maintained in a temperature-controlled room in the dark at in situ  temperature for 3&#8201;h before beginning the experiment to allow time for adaptation to any DMSP released from the cells during filtration.",
