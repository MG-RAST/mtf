Since sputum expectoration is difficult in general for Non-CF individuals, all Non-CF subjects were first required to do an oral rinse with water to prevent excessive salivary contamination and then take five deep breaths to loosen lung secretions. Subjects were then instructed to cough deeply into a sterile cup. The deep breathing and coughing procedures were repeated until at least 1 ml of sputum was obtained.",
