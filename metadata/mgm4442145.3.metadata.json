Oxygen minimum zone viral metagenomes were constructed by filtering 40 l of water collected using a CTD rosette lowered to a sampling depth of 90 and 200 m (OxMinZoneVir200806\u00ad90 and OxMinZoneVir200806\u00ad200 respectively). Samples were concentrated through a 100 kDa tangential flow filter to retain viral particles. The concentrate was passed through a 0.45 &#956;m sterivex filter to remove larger cells and treated with chloroform. The viruses were purified using cesium chloride (CsCl) step gradients to remove free DNA and any cellular material.",
