    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "On 27 and 28 September 2002 50-liter surface water samples were collected using a diaphragm pump at nine stations along the midstem of the Chesapeake Bay (stations 908 [39\u00b008&#8242;N, 76\u00b020&#8242;W], 858 [38\u00b058&#8242;N, 76\u00b023&#8242;W], 845 [38\u00b045&#8242;N, 76\u00b026&#8242;W], 834 [38\u00b034&#8242;N, 76\u00b026&#8242;W], 818 [38\u00b018&#8242;N, 76\u00b017&#8242;W], 804 [38\u00b004&#8242;N, 76\u00b013&#8242;W], 744 [37\u00b044&#8242;N, 76\u00b011&#8242;W], 724 [37\u00b024&#8242;N, 76\u00b005&#8242;W], and 707 [37\u00b007&#8242;N, 76\u00b007&#8242;W]). At station 858 a bottom water sample from 2 m above the sediment-water interface was also obtained using Niskin bottles on a conductivity-temperature-depth rosette. Water was passed through a 25-&#956;m wound cartridge filter, and viruses were concentrated using a two-step tangential flow filtration process, resulting in an approximately 250-ml viral concentrate sample. In the first tangential flow filtration step a 0.22-&#956;m-pore-size, 0.5-m2  Pellicon cartridge filter (Millipore Corp.) was used to remove all cells. Viruses in the 0.22-&#956;m filtrate were concentrated to a final volume of 2 liters using 10-m2 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff spiral filters (Helicon; Millipore Corp.). In the final step a smaller (0.5-m2) 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff spiral filter (Pellicon; Millipore Corp.) was used to concentrate viruses in a final volume of 250 ml. On shore, 200 ml of each viral concentrate was further concentrated using 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff Centricon Plus-80 spin filters (Millipore Corp.) to a final volume of approximately 2 ml.",
