Seawater was sequentially filtered through a 5 \u00b5m pore size polycarbonate filter and the filtrate passed through 0.22 \u00b5m pore size Sterivex filters (Durapore, Millipore) using a peristaltic pumping system. Sterivex filters were filled with lysis buffer (40 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris/ HCl, 0.75M sucrose) and stored at &#8722;20\u00b0C, until DNA extraction.",
