Box cores were subcored as described by Alperin and Reeburgh (4). Sediment samples were collected from discrete depths from the sediment- water interface to the bottom of each core by inserting the barrel of a syringe into predrilled holes in polycarbonate core tubes. The sediment samples were imme- diately sealed in cans (while excluding air and gas) and stored at 4\u00b0C during transport to the laboratory.",
