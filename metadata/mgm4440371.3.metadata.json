All P. compressa samples were collected 25 m offshore at 1 m depth and 5 m apart. Ambient sea surface water temperature was 24\u00b0C. Three apparently healthy coral heads of approximately 20 cm in diameter were removed with hammer and chisel at the base of the colony to avoid polyp damage. Specimens were placed in a 3 l seawater-cured bucket, carried to shore, and immediately transferred to open outdoor aquaria that contained continuous flowing seawater.",
