From one to four Sterivex filters were used at each depth, depending on the volume of sample filtered (Table 1, main text). The glass fiber GFA prefilters were replaced after each 20 liters filtered. After seawater collection, the Sterivex filters were covered with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.3, containing 40mM EDTA and 0.75M sucrose) and frozen at -80\u00b0C. Samples were transported back to the laboratory on dry ice, and stored at -80\u00b0C until DNA extraction.",
