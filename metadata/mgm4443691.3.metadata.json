Samples were placed into filtered sterilized seawater using sterile scalpels and forceps and transported on ice to the laboratory at UNSW (approximately 15&#8201;min travelling time) for direct processing. Surface barnacles were removed from the sponge and wet weights were recorded. Throughout the subsequent cell-separation procedure, samples were taken for microscopic observations. Bacterial cells are separated from sponge cells and tissue using a series of filtration and centrifugation steps.",
