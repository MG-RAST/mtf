    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "n 10 October, 2006, coastal surface water was collected from the end of the pier located at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA. The sampled water was processed for chlorophyll, nutrient and flow cytometry analysis. Chlorophyll measurements were obtained from unfiltered seawater and seawater filtered through a 2.0 &#956;m polycarbonate filter (GE Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN). Five hundred millilitres were passed through GF/F filters (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C. Within 2 weeks, chlorophyll was extracted from the filters with 90% acetone in dark at &#8722;20\u00b0C overnight. Samples for flow cytometry were preserved with 0.25% gluteraldehyde and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C. The samples were analysed at the highest flow rate using a Becton-Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer as described by Collier and Palenik (2003), but without applying a compensation matrix.  A concentrated picoplankton sample was obtained for flow cytometry sorting as follows: Three litres were filtered through 2.0 &#956;m polycarbonate filters (GE Osmonics) to remove zooplankton and large phytoplankton. The < 2.0 &#956;m picoplankton, including Synechococcus, were captured onto 0.45 &#956;m Supor 200 filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and re-suspended by repetitively flushing the filters with 1 ml of seawater using a pipettor. In total, 8 ml of concentrated and re-suspended picoplankton was obtained.  Using flow cytometry, Synechococcus cells are distinguished from other picoplankton by the fluorescence of their phycoerythrin pigments. From the picoplankton concentrate, Synechococcus cells were sorted using a FACS Vantage DiVa instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The sorted cells were collected onto a 0.2 &#956;m Supor 200 filter (Pall) and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C.",
