    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "Samples were collected on June 30, 2005 from Hydrostation S (32\u00b0 10' N, 64\u00b0 30' W) located in the northwestern Sargasso Sea approximately 26 km southeast of the island of Bermuda, essentially the same spot the Surge Samples were collected. Water from 80 m was retrieved via the R.V. Weatherbird II's CTD rosette equipped with 12 liter Niskin bottles. This depth was targeted because summer subsurface maximum in viral like particles (VLP) is historically located between 80 and 100 m. Upon recovery of CTD, seawater was transferred to a precleaned 150 L polypropylene carboy via acid washed silicone tubing. Viruses were concentrated using a Pelicon II tangential flow filtration system (Millipore Corporation; Bedford, MA) equipped with a 30 kd Biomax cassette filter (0.5 m2; modified polyethersulfone). Prior to collection the filter was cleaned with 0.1 N H3P04 recirculated for 45 minutes followed by 0.1N NaOH recirculated for 45 minutes. One-hundred and fifty liters of seawater was recirculated over the 30 kD filter until the retentate volume was ~150 ml. This concentration step took ~3 hours to complete. The final concentrate was distributed into four 45 ml aliquots in sterile Falcon tubes. Five ml of chloroform was added to each tube, stored and shipped at 4\u00b0 C until arrival at SDSU.",
