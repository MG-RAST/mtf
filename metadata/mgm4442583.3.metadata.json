The ends were made blunt using the DNATerminator end repair kit (Lucigen, Middleton, WI), and the fragments were ligated to a double-stranded asymmetrical linker comprised of one blunt phosphorylated end (5&#8242;-GATGCGGCCGCTTGTATCTGATACTGCT-3&#8242;; linker 1) and one nonphosphorylated, staggered end (5&#8242;-GGAGCAGTATCAGATACAAGCGGCCGCATC-3&#8242;; linker 2) to fix the primer in a defined orientation relative to the genomic DNA.",

Viral particles were concentrated to 2 liters, filtered through a 0.2-&#956;m filter, and further concentrated to 100 ml using a 100-kDa filter. Viral concentrates were imaged by transmission electron microscopy (Leo 912AB operating at 80 kV). Direct viral enumeration was performed by epifluorescence microscopy (51). Following the recommendations of Wen et al. (84), samples were unfixed and were stained with Sybr gold. The samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for no more than 24 h before being counted. Immediate freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen was not possible, so viral abundances may be somewhat underestimated.",
