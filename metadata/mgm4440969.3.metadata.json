Four replicate 6 cm thick x 8 mm diameter cores were excised from the middle of the mat sample using a sterile coring instrument. Each core was sectioned into coins as described in Table S2 using sterile scalpel blades for each layer. The mat is vertically striated and these striations were used to ensure that coins 40\twere obtained from the same layer of each replicate core. Coins were frozen on liquid nitrogen.",
