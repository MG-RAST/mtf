    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "Seawater samples were collected on 12 occasions during 2007 from the L4 sampling site (50\u00b015.00' N, 4\u00b013.02'W) of the WCO (http://www.westernchannelobservatory.org.uk). The sampling dates were 16 February, 7 March, 25 March, 23 April, 8 May, 6 June, 25 June, 30 July, 20 August, 29 September, 25 October and 12 December. Sixteen environmental variables were obtained from the WCO database, available on the website; these included surface temperature, salinity, water density, silicate concentration, nitrate + nitrite concentration, chlorophyll concentration, total organic nitrogen concentration, ammonium concentration, SRP concentration and total organic carbon concentration. Other variables measured were flow cytometric determination of bacterial abundance, microscope counts of cryptophyte, picoeukaryote, nanoeukaryote, coccolithophore and small dinoflagellate abundance (Table 3). Nucleic acid was extracted from 5 l seawater, collected from the surface and filtered immediately through a 0.22 &#956;m Sterivex cartridge (Millipore), which was stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C. DNA was isolated from each sample (Neufeld et al., 2007) and then stored at &#8722;20\u00b0C.",
