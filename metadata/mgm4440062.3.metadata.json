Each fish was classified as healthy or morbid by veterinarians upon visual inspection. Fish were sacrificed with an overdose of MS\u00ad222 (Finquel, Argent Laboratories), and examined for the presence of gross external and internal lesions to confirm preliminary diagnoses. Symptomatic fish had empty gut contents. Five symptomatic and five asymptomatic fish were selected and gut contents were collected by flushing aseptically with 10 mL of SM buffer. Samples were sonicated (15 seconds, 3 times) and then centrifuged at 150 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then filtered (0.45 &#956;m and 0.2 &#956;m) to separate the microbial fraction (attached onto the filter) from the viruses (filtrate). Viral particles in the filtrate were purified using a CsCl step gradient and viral DNA was extracted as described by Thurber [5].",
