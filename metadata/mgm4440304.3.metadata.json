Virus-sized particles in the filtrate were concentrated ca. 50- to 700-fold by ultrafiltration using a 10 or 30 kDa-cutoff Amicon/Millipore (S1Y10/S1Y30/S10Y30) spiral cartridge and then stored at 4\u00b0C in the 2 dark. One milliliter of each virus concentrate (VC) was combined into a mix. The Gulf of Mexico mix consisted of 41 different virus communities (3.65 x 1010 vlps per ml).",
