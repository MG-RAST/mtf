After ligation to Bst XI adapters (Invitrogen, catalog no.N408-18), DNA was purified by three rounds of gel electrophoresis to remove excess adapters, and the fragments, now with 3'-CACA overhangs, were inserted into Bst XI- linearized plasmid vector with 3'-TGTG overhangs. Fragments were cloned in a medium- copy pBR322 derivative.",
