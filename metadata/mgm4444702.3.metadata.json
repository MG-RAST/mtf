Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two diets in the first period and received the other diet in the second period. Dogs were fed 300&#8201;g of diet once daily, which was determined to meet the metabolizable energy needs of the heaviest dog based on National Research Council, (2006) recommendations. At each feeding, uneaten food from the previous feeding was collected and weighed. A 4-day collection phase followed a 10-day diet adaptation phase, during which fresh (within 15&#8201;min of defecation) fecal samples were collected from each dog. Fresh feces were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C until DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nGenomic DNA was extracted and isolated from fecal samples using a modification of the method of Yu and Morrison, (2004) and described by Middelbos et al. (2010).",
