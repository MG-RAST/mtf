    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "Coral specimens were collected at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) on 22 February 2006. All P. compressa samples were collected 25 m offshore at 1 m depth and 5 m apart. Ambient sea surface water temperature was 24\u00b0C. Three apparently healthy coral heads of approximately 20 cm in diameter were removed with hammer and chisel at the base of the colony to avoid polyp damage. Specimens were placed in a 3 l seawater-cured bucket, carried to shore, and immediately transferred to open outdoor aquaria that contained continuous flowing seawater.Coral heads were broken into five fingers of equal size, &#8764;30-40 g. Each finger was sampled prior to placement in the tanks (Time Zero samples). Each coral finger was then placed in different glass aquaria (12.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 8 inches), containing 5 l of treatment water. At each time point (1, 4, 16 and 64 h) all three fingers were sequentially removed from the tank, placed on sterile autoclaved aluminium foil, and 1-2 g of samples or 'nubbins' were cut away with a sterile razor blade. Nubbins were vigorously rinsed with filtered autoclaved seawater (FASW), placed in 15 ml tubes containing 10 ml of RNALater (Ambion; Foster City, CA) and stored at &#8722;20\u00b0C.",
