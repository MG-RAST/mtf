Both daytime and nighttime samples were collected into into acid-washed and seawater-rinsed polycarbonate bottles of varying  volumes. Water for DNA and RNA samples was filtered using peristaltic-pump-driven positive-pressure filtration serially through 10&#8201;&#956;m polycarbonate (GE Osmonics, Trevose, PA, USA) and 0.2&#8201;&#956;m Supor (Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) filters. For RNA, 3&#8201;l were filtered, and the filters were placed immediately into microcentrifuge tubes containing 100&#8201;&#956;l glass beads and 350&#8201;&#956;l RLT buffer (RNEasy kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples for DNA (4&#8201;l) were filtered per the RNA samples and placed into microcentrifuge tubes containing 200&#8201;&#956;l TE buffer. The filters were then frozen in liquid nitrogen for transport to the laboratory at the University of California Santa Cruz.",
