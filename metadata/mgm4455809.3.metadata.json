Only soils unsaturated for the majority of the year were examined. Soils were collected near the height of the plant growing season at each location. To examine whether seasonal variation was important, an additional set of soil samples was collected 6 months after the initial collection at a subset of sites. At each site, the upper 5 cm of mineral soil was collected from 5-10 locations within a given plot of &#8776;100 m2 and composited into a single bulk sample. All soil samples were shipped to the University of California, Santa Barbara, within a few days of collection, where they were sieved to 4 mm, homogenized, and archived at -80C.\r\n\r\nApproximately 10 g of soil from each site was homogenized in a mortar and pestle with liquid N2, and DNAs were extracted from a 0.5-g subsample by use of a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions, with an additional incubation step at 65C for 10 min followed by 2 min of bead beating to limit DNA shearing. Eluted DNAs were stored at &#8722;20C.",
