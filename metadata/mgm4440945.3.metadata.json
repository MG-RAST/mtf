Three grams of wet fecal sample were suspended vigorously in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.",
