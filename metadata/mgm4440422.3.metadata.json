At the time of sampling, hybrid striped bass were being raised in the main ponds. The Tilapia Channel (FW1) received the effluent from 96 production ponds. These sampling sites integrate the microbial and viral communities from either the nursery or the production ponds, thus avoiding pond-to-pond variation. Water samples were collected in November 2005, April 2006, and August 2006. Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The microbial fraction was collected from the 0.2-&#956;m TFF retentate by centrifugation at ~2000 \u00d7 g for 10&#8201;min. Microbial DNA was extracted using the Ultra Clean Soil DNA Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, CA, USA).",
