Swabs were replaced into their original self-sealing specimen containers and transported to the laboratory. Viral concentrates from 19 individual samples were comb xined to form a pooled sample. Half of the pooled sample was filtered with a 0.22-&#956;m Millex-HV filter to remove cellular material. DNase I was added to the sample to a final concentration of 10 &#956;g\u00b7mL&#8722;1, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to degrade free DNA. The other half of the pooled sample was treated with chloroform but not filtered. Twenty microliters of chlorofrom was added per milliliter of viral concentrate, and the sample was then incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h and centrifuged at 2155 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant containing the viral concentrate was col- lected and treated with DNase I as described above. DNA was extracted from the filtered and chloroformed samples using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/formamide protocol",
