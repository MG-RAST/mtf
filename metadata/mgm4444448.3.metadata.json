    "sample-isolation-and-treatment_sample_isolation_description": "We collected saliva and oropharyngeal samples over a one-week period from three adult individuals with informed consent. Saliva samples were collected by expectoration into a sterile plastic 50-ml tube and kept frozen at &#9251; 20 \u00b0C until processing. We mixed 100 &#956;L of each saliva sample with the same volume of 2\u00d7 lysis buffer [Tris 20 mM, EDTA 2 mM (pH 8), Tween 1%, proteinase K (Fermentas) 400 &#9251;g/ml] and incubated them for 2 h at 55 \u00b0C (Faveri et al., 2008). Proteinase K was inactivated by a 10 min incubation at 95 \u00b0C and the samples were frozen at &#9251;20 \u00b0C. Dry cotton swabs (Copan) were used to gently swab the poste- rior wall of the oropharynx. They were directly suspended in a microtube containing 200 &#9251;L of lysis buffer and processed in the same way as the saliva samples. The saliva and oropharyngeal lys- ates from all three subjects were mixed in a 1:10 ratio with roughly equal contributions from the two sampling sites according to PCR yield.",
