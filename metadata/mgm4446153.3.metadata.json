Cores were stored intact in Ziploc bags at ambient temperature and immediately transported to the lab, where they were used for growth inocula or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted using a modified CTAB extraction method with bead beating and phenol-chloro- form extraction, with the following exceptions: phosphate buffer concentration was 250 mM; 50 &#956;L 100 mM aluminum ammonium sulfate (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the soils as a flocculant for excess humics.",
