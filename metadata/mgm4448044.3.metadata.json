Fresh stool samples were obtained at home, and samples were immediately frozen by storing them in their home freezer. Frozen samples were delivered to the Hospital using insulating polystyrene foam containers, and then they were stored at -80&#8201;\u00b0C until analysis. A frozen aliquot (200&#8201;mg) of each faecal sample was suspended in 250&#8201;&#956;l of guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1&#8201;M Tris (pH 7.5) and 40&#8201;&#956;l of 10% N-lauroyl sarcosine. Then, DNA extraction was conducted as previously described22. The DNA concentration and its molecular size were estimated by nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and agarose gel electrophoresis.",
