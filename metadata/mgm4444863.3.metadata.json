Possibility of entrainment of ambient seawater was not ruled out. Immediately after retrieval, 0.2-&#956;m- and 0.1-&#956;m-Sterivex filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) were consecutively used to trap microorganisms (Miyoshi et al. 2005) and frozen onboard at &#8722;20\u00b0C. The Teflon and Tygon tubes and polypropylene bottles were washed with HCl and autoclaved before use.",
