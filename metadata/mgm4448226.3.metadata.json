Possibility of entrainment of ambient seawater was not ruled out. Immediately after retrieval, 0.2-&#956;m- and 0.1-&#956;m-Sterivex filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) were consecutively used to trap 0.2-&#956;m-passable microorganisms (Miyoshi et al. 2005), and frozen onboard at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C. The Teflon and Tygon tubes for filtration and the polypropylene bottles for sample storage were washed with HCl and autoclaved before use. The mixed genomic DNA of 0.2-&#956;m-passable microorganisms used in this research is the same extracted DNA (0.69 &#956;g) as that used in the previous PCR clone library analysis of collaborative authors, Naganuma et al. (2007). Multiple displacement amplification (MDA), with phi29 DNA polymerase, was used to obtain a sufficient (>10 &#956;g) DNA sample for 454 pyrosequencing. ",
