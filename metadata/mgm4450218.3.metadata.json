Periodically over the 29-day fermentation period, three bags were sacrificed, the contents were filtered through three layers of coarse gauze (Daehan, Republic of Korea) to remove only large kimchi particles, and the filtrates were pooled. The pH of each filtrate was measured immediately, and the filtrates were centrifuged (8,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C) to harvest microorganisms. The pellets and supernatants were stored at \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u009680\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C for extraction of bulk genomic DNA and metabolite analysis, respectively. One ml of each sample was centrifuged separately for the measurement of 16S rRNA gene copies using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). The kimchi samples were identified as Jx, where \"x\" designates the sample day during fermentation.",
